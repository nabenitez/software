# Software Engineering Project
This was my first approach to web development, is a basic app that allow users to see study groups in rooms and join them, send inbox messages between users, show events, show courses and add them to MyCourses, register to tutorials. Basically a lot of scaffold with some logic :smile: but it works. 
We worked with RoR, html and Bootstrap. It may have a lot of problems.
